# KronosCRM - Modular CRM Platform (Portfolio Project)

> 📌 **Note**: This repository represents a public commitment to myself to complete a full-stack, modular CRM system for portfolio purposes. As of today, the project is in the planning and foundational stages. This document outlines the scope, vision, and step-by-step execution plan — serving both as a roadmap and an accountability tool.

> It’s not a finished product (yet), but a transparent record of how I approach large-scale system design and development over time.

## 📘 Overview

KronosCRM is a **fully modular, cloud-native CRM** designed as a portfolio project to showcase my abilities in **backend development, multi-language microservices, cloud infrastructure, and scalable software architecture**. While not built for production deployment (yet), this project grows over time and serves as an evolving demonstration of my technical skills, design thinking, and implementation processes.

This project is not meant to reinvent the wheel in CRM systems — it’s meant to demonstrate **how I work**, **how I manage complexity**, and **how I architect scalable and maintainable systems**.

## 🎯 Goals

* ✅ Demonstrate ability to manage a modular microservices architecture
* ✅ Showcase real-world APIs and features expected in a CRM
* ✅ Use **multiple languages** to show versatility and adaptability
* ✅ Include integrations with real-world services (email, Twilio, Salesforce, Meta, etc.)
* ✅ Follow best practices: DTOs, layered architecture, cloud-native, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD

## 🌐 Frontend

* **Next.js** (TypeScript)
* Tailwind CSS
* Frontend renders only active modules based on user roles

---

## 🧠 Why So Many Languages?

KronosCRM is designed to **prove adaptability**. In real jobs, teams work with legacy systems, language-specific SDKs, or performance constraints. By building each module in a different language:

* I demonstrate my fluency across ecosystems
* I show I can onboard onto diverse stacks
* I force myself to manage API standardization, serialization, and cross-language consistency

This project is also meant to highlight **how I learn** and how I **build infrastructure to support flexible, scalable systems**.

---

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Replication Notes

To ensure transparency and reproducibility, I will include in this repository (or linked sub-repositories):

* All YAML files for Kubernetes deployments, services, volumes, and configs
* Terraform configurations for infrastructure provisioning
* CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
* Helm charts (if used)
* Secrets and credentials will always be excluded or replaced with environment variables

> 📘 **Legend**: Any infrastructure-as-code or pod setup found in this repository is shared for educational/demo purposes. Others are welcome to reuse or adapt them in their own environments.

## 🏗️ How This Grows Over Time

* New modules are added monthly
* Integrations are refined with real-world APIs
* Monitoring/logging tooling is expanded (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
* Multi-tenant support is extended
* Infrastructure code is hardened with Terraform and GitHub Actions

---

## 📬 Want to Collaborate or Review?

If you're a hiring manager, engineer, or mentor — I'd love feedback or code review. This is open-source, growing, and an honest reflection of how I build.
